# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
Driver drowsiness detection is a project built using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.
<h3>Logic of project</h3>
The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library.
The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which 
we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.</br></br>
